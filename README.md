Will be hosted at [repolicense.com](https://repolicense.com)

This project has been created as I felt like the amount of licenses available can be overwhelming and I wanted to provide a simple and easy to use tool for selecting the right license for your open source project.

If you have any feedback or suggestions for improvements, please create an issue on GitHub or reach out to me directly on [this email](mailto:contact+repolicense@lucashanson.dk?subject=Repolicense%20feedback) email.
