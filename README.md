Welcome to **Repolicense**! This project was created to simplify the often overwhelming task of selecting the right license for your open-source project. With so many licensing options available, it can be difficult to determine which one best fits your needs. 
Repolicense aims to solve this by providing a simple, intuitive tool that guides you through the process of choosing the appropriate license based on your project's requirements.

You can explore the tool at [repolicense.com](https://repolicense.com).
